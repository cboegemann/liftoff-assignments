# Group Project Outline

### Overview

We want to make an MVC application that will allow users to create their own Choose Your Own Adventure stories. It will allow anyone to play an already made story, and will allow registered users to track which ones they’ve played and their progress therein. It will also allow registered users to create their own stories for
others to play through. Only the creator of a story will be able to edit or delete their own story.

### Features

- User authentication - Users will be able to create their own account profile that they can use to login.
- Create / edit / delete - Users will be able to create/edit/delete their stories 
- Search/filter - Users will be able to use a search function with filtering options

### Technologies

- C#
- Visual Studio
- MySQL
- ASP.NET Core 5.0
- Bootstrap
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### What We'll Have to Learn

- We will need to learn more about User Validations and Identity, including how to implement user authentication. 
- We will need to learn how to implement edit and delete features within an application.

# Christine's Original Project Outline

### Overview

As someone who loves to cook food almost as much as I love to eat it, I wanted to make an app that would help me track recipes that users create as they develop them.
This app is meant to function as an organizational tool, so by design, the recipes would be stored privately and will only be shared with users who were explicitely granted permissions to view them.
This app will enable users to name their recipes and log details such as ingredients, tools, and steps used to make their latest culinary concoction. Importantly, it will also enables users to make comments so they can refer back to remind themselves what they thought about their cooking attempt. They will also be able to easily mark off if the recipe contains common allergens and what dietary restrictions it accomodates.

### Features

- User authentication - Users will be able to create their own account profile that they can use to login.
- Create / edit / delete recipe - Users will be able to create a recipe using the template offered on the website. They can save that recipe and view it later. They can edit and delete that recipe as well.
- Search/filter recipe - Users will be able to use a search function with filtering options to locate recipes that meet their desired search parameters.

### Technologies

- C#
- Visual Studio
- MySQL
- ASP.NET Core 6.0
- Bootstrap

### What I'll Have to Learn
